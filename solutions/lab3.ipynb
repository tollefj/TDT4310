So, let's say you made a decision; you, as the justifier, need to give good reasons (justifications) for your choice. You might use justifying words to make your point clear and reasonable. Justifying can be a bit like saying, \"Here's why I did what I did.\" When you justify things, you're basically providing the why behind your actions. So, being a good justifier involves carefully explaining, giving reasons, and making sure others understand your choices\n",
